Family web server that runs on a local router using Rust Actix. Monitors activity on the router and detects whether device associated with a user is streaming data. Very primitive UI to set up local users. Created to monitor my kids watching habits and provide a mechanism to allow them to watch using a point system. You can refill the points as a parent and then the points are delimited as the kids use streaming data. Very early prototype and very rough. Streaming data is not differentiated from playing games and watching videos as yet. Will be migrating to a system using eBPF for performance and better control as well as differentiating between video and games.
